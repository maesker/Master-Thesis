# CPU threshold 1 means that the cpu is considered to be overloaded if all cpu cores are working on the limit
# CPU threshold < 1 means that the cpu is considered to be overloaded even if cpu can still take some load
# allowed values are between 0 and 1
cpu_threshold=1

# Server is considered to be overloaded if there are more than max_no_of_threads * thread_threashold active threads
# allowed values are between 0 and 1
thread_threshold=0.95

# Server is considered to be overloaded if there are more than swaps_max * swaps_threshold swaps in ganesha
# allowed values are between 0 and 1
swaps_threshold=0.95

# Max number of possible threads per process. (derived from a default ubuntu 64-bit installation)
max_no_of_threads=32000

# Max number of ganehsa swaps before system is considered to be overloaded 
max_no_of_swaps=100


# Weights to make load metrics comparable 
# e.g. cpu load is a small value while number of swaps and number of threads are big values
# e.g. reasonable weighting could be w_cpu = 1, w_swaps = 0.1, w_threads = 0.05 .
# allowed values are between 0 and 1
