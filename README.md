# Master-Thesis

Title: Overcoming write penalties of conflicting client operations in distributed storage systems

Basically, it's a redundant, lock-free distributed RAID-4/5 controller that I developed in 2012. 

For details please refer to the presentation or thesis. 

The source contains code from our 2011 project group and my thesis. Some of the dependencies had API changes that break the current build process. Once I have some free time, I'll fix those and add a proper readme.



# Problem:
Erasure coding in distributed environments:

# P2P Cluster: 

Solution: A P2P Cluster with distributed, redundant, multi-version state management and a lock-free commit protocol

# Evaluation 

The system has been evaluated at the Grid5000 Clusters Suno, Helios, Griffon, Granduc and Luxembourg
The graph show that my lock-free cluster saturate the hardware by over 90%.
